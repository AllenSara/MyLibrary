# MyLibrary
This program was created in order to text the efficency of the dictionaryðŸ“–, listðŸ“ƒ, and treeðŸŒ³ data types.
Each data type has its own class, which contains functions in order to insert, search, print, and delete books.
The books are inserted using a CSV file named books, which can be found in the program folder.
The program runs through the program file, where testing for each data type is commented out by section and can be run by uncommenting the relevant section.
A summary of the efficency findings can be found in efficency.docx.
